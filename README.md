## Technologies I used

1. React for builing UI
2. Styled components for styling
3. Vercel for deploying.

Besides above technologies, I used some other helpful libraries such as:

- `react-scroll` for smooth scrolling to each sections of the website.
- `react-toastify` for beautiful, elegant and reusable Toast component.
